[kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) kubernetes native configuration management tool. A template-free way to customize application configuration that simplifies the use of off-the-shelf applications

## Repository Overview

This repository contains kustomize kubernetes manifest using which a  [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/) [daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) can be deployed on EKS or any kubernetes platform. 

## Files Overview

* **ha-proxy-deployment.yaml :** base deployment manifest for HAProxy. 

* **haproxy.cfg :** HAProxy native configuration, configmap will be dynamically generated by kustomize on the fly. 

* **haproxy-service.yaml :** kubernetes service manifest to expose service daemonset.

* **kustomization.yaml:** kustomize configuration file. Values to be overwriiten are mentioned here.

* **nginx-deployment.yaml :** sample nginx deployment to validate HAProxy deployment.  Traffic request to HAProxy service on port 80 will forward the request to this nginx deployment.

## Architecture

After deployment, HAProxy will be running on each and every worker node. HAProxy service will accept traffic on three ports, 80, 5000 & 9000.

* 80 - Incoming request which will be forwarded to a backend service
* 5000 - Flask application which will fetch and return ec2-metadata when running on EKS.
* 9000 - HA proxy health & traffic stats
